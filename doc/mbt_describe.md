## mbt describe

Describe the modules in the repo

### Synopsis


Describe the modules in the repo

Displays all modules discovered in repo according to the sub command 
used. This can be used to understand the impact of executing the build 
command.

You can control the output of this command using --json and --graph flags.

--json flag is self explanatory.
--graph flag outputs the dependency graph in dot format. This can be piped 
into graphviz tools such as dot to produce a graphical representation of 
the dependency graph of the repo.

e.g.
mbt describe head --graph | dot -Tpng > /tmp/graph.png && open /tmp/graph.png

	

### Options

```
      --graph   format output as dot graph
  -h, --help    help for describe
      --json    format output as json
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --debug       enable debugging
      --in string   path to repo
```
